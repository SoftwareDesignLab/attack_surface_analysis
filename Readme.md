# Attack Surface Analysis
This repository includes the data used in the paper entitled "A Grounded Theory Based Approach to Characterize Software Attack Surfaces"

## Folder Structure
We provide the summary of the data included in each folder: 
- **1. All Collected Data:** All Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) and Common Weakness Enumerations (CWEs) that were retrieved from the National Vulnerability Database during the *First*,  *Second* and *Third* stages of Data Collection (Section 2.2).
- **2. Coded Data:** This folder contains the open codes obtained from all CVEs and CWEs.
- **3. Memos:** It contains the notes taken throughout the data analysis ("memoing").
<<<<<<< HEAD
- **4. Core Categories:** Core categories obtained for Targets (What), Entry Points(Where), and Mechanisms (How).
- **5. Coding Tool:** Information about the tool used during open coding and its source code.
=======
- **4. Axial Code:** This folder contains the axial codes that show how open codes and concepts are grouped into categories.
- **5. Core Categories:** Core categories obtained in selective coding for Targets (What), Entry Points(Where), and Mechanisms (How).
- **6. Coding Tool:** Detailed information (and source code) about the tool used during for open coding.
